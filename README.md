# Student Mental Health Prediction

This project predicts student depression levels using machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, ANN, and SVM — implemented from scratch. It includes preprocessing, feature selection, model evaluation, and performance comparison.

## Features
- Binary classification of depression symptoms
- Custom implementations in NumPy and Pandas
- Accuracy comparison of ML models

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the Python files in order (data cleaning → model training → evaluation)
3. Use Jupyter Notebook or standard Python interpreter

## Dataset
The dataset contains academic, lifestyle, and mental health indicators of students. Preprocessing includes handling missing values, normalization, and encoding.
